  The graph shows the total death toll and the expenses.
  In order to better understand it we recommend to read a
  <a href="https://boundedlyrational.substack.com/p/on-the-dilemma-between-lives-and"
    target ="_blank">blog post from our coworker Jan Kulveit</a>.
  But these are not the only costs the pandemic had.
  <strong>
    In your game, students lost at least
    {{stats.schoolDaysLost.total}} school days
  </strong>.
  This loss will affect groups that had
  already been struggling with school the worst.

  Let’s get a better idea of what your spending means.
</div>
<ul>
  <li>Your pandemic costs: <strong>{{stats.costs.total}}</strong>
  <li>State budget in 2019: <strong>{{budget2019}}</strong>
  <li>State budget in 2020: <strong>{{budget2020}}</strong>
</ul>

<p>
  Before you look at the results, we just want to note that our simulation only reflects a fraction
  of the problems connected with the Covid-19 pandemic. There are many other issues that our simplified model
  does not address: the long-term effects of Covid, the impact on people’s mental health, or how the pandemic will change the world for the future.

  In this, we hope that you will use the game as a starting point that will motivate you to find out more.
  We will still mention a few things, though.
  We could legitimately say that in your game, the number of infected people was not
  <strong>{{stats.detectedInfections.total}}</strong>,
  but, including reinfections, there were up to <strong>{{estimateInfectionsTotal}}</strong> infections, according to
  <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-deaths-statistics-data-cases-accuracy/">experts’ theories</a>.

  The game and your results only register the officially recorded infections (based on test data).
